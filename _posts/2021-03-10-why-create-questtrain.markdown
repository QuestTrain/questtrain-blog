**By: Michael Vogelsong**

I've always been fascinated with learning. How do I learn something new? How does a baby figure out movement and language so quickly? How does a community evolve over time to better address the needs of its members - i.e., collectively learn? How do we gain an understanding another person's lived experiences, and gain that sense of empathy and perspective? What happens during that magical transition when a concept goes from foggy foresight to obvious hindsight?

I believe that the root of learning is not about building a big database of "answers." Rather, it's about crafting **trains of questions** that (a) make useful new ideas obvious and natural, and (b) welcomes others into the process. A "answer" is a wall; a question is an open door.

# What is QuestTrain's goal?

You guessed it, there is no single right answer. But here are some useful framing questions:

- **Understanding engine**: What would a search engine look like if the goal was deeper understanding of nuanced topics, rather than click-through?
- **Version control for critical thinking, decision-making, and actions**: How do we bring the advantages of software development into the learning process?
- **Human-machine learning model**: Can we collectively build an interpretable, inclusive, and diverse AI model of the world? What would we learn if we could only cite data from primary sources?
- **Presentations/papers designed for the audience**: What is the best way to share understanding with an audience?
- **Efficient teaching**: How do I "hop on the train of thought" of a person I respect? How do I get a feel for how they approach a difficult problem?
- **Goal-oriented view of the world**: Would we make more efficient progress on hard problems if we looked at how systems should or could address goals, rather than definitions of how things currently exist?

To ground our questions, we provide two additional primitives: data carts and actions. **Data carts** are the placeholders we reserve for data to feed in - the primary-source information that is relevant to making decisions on our questions. **Actions** are automations (APIs, webhooks, etc.) that can be triggered based on information in those data carts. These few primitives provide the building blocks for much more.

# Bottom line

QuestTrain is an attempt to make questions cool. Interested? [Try it out!](https://questtrain.com)
