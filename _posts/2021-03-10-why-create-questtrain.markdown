**By: Michael Vogelsong**

I've always been fascinated with learning. How does a person learn something new? How does a baby figure out language and movement so quickly? How does a community evolve over time to better address the needs of its members -- collective learning? How do we gain an understanding one another's lived experiences, and gain that sense of empathy and perspective? What happens during that magical transition when a concept goes from foggy foresight to obvious hindsight?

By now, you've probably noticed I like questions. I believe that the root of learning is not about building a big database of "answers." Rather, it's about crafting **trains of questions** that (a) make useful new ideas and better decisions obvious and natural, and (b) welcomes others into the process. A claimed "answer" is a wall; a question is an open door.

# What is QuestTrain's goal?

You guessed it, there is no single right answer. But here are some useful framing questions:

- **Understanding engine**: What would a search engine look like if the goal was deeper understanding, rather than click-through?
- **Version control for critical thinking, decision-making, and actions**: How do we bring the advantages of software development into critical thinking?
- **Human-machine learning model**: Can we collectively build an interpretable, inclusive, and diverse AI model of the world? What would we learn if we could only cite primary source data?
- **Presentations/papers designed for the audience**: What is the best way to share understanding with an audience?
- **Efficient teaching**: How do I "get into the head" of a person I respect? How do I get a feel for how they approach a difficult problem?

To ground our questions, we provide two additional primitives: data placeholders and actions. **Data placeholders** are the slots we reserve for data to feed in -- the primary-source information that is relevant to one of more questions. **Actions** are automations (APIs, webhooks, etc.) that can be triggered based on information in those data feeds. With these building blocks, we can build lots of cool things!

QuestTrain is an attempt to elevate the status of good questions. Oh, maybe that is an answer... but how could we make it better? [Let's find out, together!](https://questtrain.com)
